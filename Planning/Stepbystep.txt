Come up with betas for different companies
Multiple regression
Read the regression part of the quant stuff
Best way to 
Correlation of deaths and the market or a certain stock
The narrower you keep it the more I will learn.

#WOW Project
Ephraim will do:
How did covid impact company x?
Get finanical records for companies through 
get 1 company from three sectors along with the NASDAQ
API:such as alpha vantage, API FRED 
get before2019 and present 2020
get data for all companies in a dataframe


data of number of cases and number of deaths in 2020
Stick with companies that are based in the U.S.
U.S. covid cases


*Graphing covid cases and stock prices overtime*
time trends of both stock price and covid cases

correlation between covid and stock prices
group regression
Ephraim Finance data of the API


Adrian will do:

	a. retrieve free API from CDC, the WHO, NYT and COVID-19py
	b. update the relevant information needed containging the varioius factors that will coinside with the financial part of the project 
	c. Use jupyter notebooks and python to generate the data which we need to be displayed 
	d. implement chronjob
